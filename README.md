# A Study on the Effect of Code Representation Techniques on Machine Learning Results for God Class Code Smell Detection

## Overview

This repository contains all resources related to the research titled **"A Study on the Effect of Code Representation Techniques on Machine Learning Results for God Class Code Smell Detection"**. The project investigates how different representations of source code affect the performance of various machine learning algorithms in detecting the God Class code smell. This includes the use of metric-based, token-based, tree-based, and code embedding techniques.

We provide the final dataset, scripts for metric features extraction, evaluation result visualizations, and an interactive web interface to navigate the evaluation results. The work aims to support reproducibility and future extensions by the research and developer community.

## Abstract

In the realm of software development, detecting code smells is a critical task for ensuring good code quality. The God Class code smell, in particular, is often characterized by excessive complexity and a high degree of subjectivity in identifying it, especially concerning coupling and cohesion levels. Automated detection techniques are vital in addressing this subjectivity.

Machine learning algorithms have shown significant potential for improving the objectivity and accuracy of God Class detection, thanks to their ability to identify complex patterns in code. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms is strongly influenced by how the source code is represented for analysis.

This study explores the impact of various code representation techniques—specifically metric-based, token-based, tree-based, and code embeddings—on machine learning performance. The MLCQ dataset was used for this investigation, and several algorithms were tested including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Naïve Bayes.

The results highlight how representation techniques affect detection performance, with the F1-score used as the primary evaluation metric to balance precision and recall. The findings reveal performance improvements over previous studies on the MLCQ dataset and offer practical guidance on code representation and model selection strategies.
